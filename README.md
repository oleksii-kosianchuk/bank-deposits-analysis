# Disclaimer
This data analysis project is a replica of the one I made during my work in a bank. However, all data has been changed and replaced with the fictitious ones in order to not disclose confidential information.
# Business Problem
The purpose of this data analysis project was to find ways to increase deposits (term and demand deposits) of Corporate Banking Department which had a declining tendency.
# Overview
The data for the project had been gathered from a company's database using SQL and then was analyzed in python and presented to management via PowerPoint. The entire client base of Corporate Banking Department, the changes in their average monthly deposits, incoming & outgoing payments over the past years have been analyzed. Have been discovered that clients tend to make significant money transfers to their own accounts in other banks and to clients of Corporate Banking Department but to accounts in other banks.

Next, the average daily money transfers have been calculated and then used in the potential increase of deposit base for each client that make relatively large payments (the cut-off have been analytically discovered and set at the level of 0.2M UAH).

In addition, there was a cooperation with relationship managers to find out the reasons on why clients send money to themselves in other banks instead of using accounts in our bank.

Also, a few more insights have been discovered during the analysis that require further research:
1. analysis of 249 deactivated client groups (which deposit volumes decreased by over 20% during the last 2 years) on the reasons of their deposits reduction and finding the possible approaches of their reactivation;
2. analysis of 96 client groups who received large percentage of money from their own accounts in other banks during 2019 in order to find approaches that would encourage them to use our bank as their main bank.
# Results
The data analysis project has revealed that average monthly deposits of Corporate Banking Department can be potentially increased by 200M UAH (+8.8%):
1. by 159M UAH (+7%) after activation of 115 client groups that transfer relatively large amount of money (>0.2M UAH) to themselves in other banks;
2. by 41M UAH (+1.8%) after work with 39 client groups that transfer relatively large amount of money (>0.2M UAH) to our clients in other banks (but could transfer them to accounts in our bank).

A few ideas have been proposed in order to achieve the money retention:
1. compare clients' forex conditions (mark-up, fees) in our bank and others, offer new FX products & services (direct dealing service, appealing hedging solutions), simplify the control of client's foreign contracts;
2. review of deposits (term & demand) interest rates on case-by-case basis to find approaches of their increase for clients with big volumes at least;
3. analysis of clients' salary project conditions in other banks in order to make a more appealing offer in our bank;
4. analysis of clients' financing options & conditions in other banks and review our financing solutions that we can offer on case-by-case basis;
5. offer new cash management solutions;
6. also, it is worth informing clients that some of their counterparties are clients of our bank and can receive payments through their accounts here.
